# Dishaster üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Wowtech


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kadeejath Siraja C A - LBS College of Engineering, Kasaragod
- Member 2: Fathima Shama - LBS College of Engineering, Kasaragod


### Project Description
Dishaster is a gloriously useless web app that generates absurd food combinations, roasts you in Manglish for even thinking about them, and lets you rate these culinary crimes. You can even add your own cursed creations to a public leaderboard‚Ä¶ if you dare.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are out here eating normal, boring meals every day. Where‚Äôs the chaos? Where‚Äôs the thrill? There‚Äôs a severe lack of a platform dedicated to bringing together truly ridiculous, flavor-questionable food pairings.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Dishaster solves this non-existent crisis by combining completely unrelated ingredients into one horrifying suggestion. It even has a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button‚Ä¶ which does absolutely nothing. Just like your diet plan.
